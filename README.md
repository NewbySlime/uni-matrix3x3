# uni-matrix3x3
Basic calculation for 3x3 matrix

This was supposedly for my mid-semester test, but why not i put it here (which the reason why it is in Indonesian (yes, i'm Indonesian))

It might be because i made progress towards learning template classes and finding the comfortable structure of the class. And i reuse the same feature as in the minesweeper code i made months ago.


# usage
The usage is pretty straightforward, user will be prompt what kind of calculation he wants. Then the user have to edit or input each content of the matri(x/ces) in order for the calculation working as expected.
